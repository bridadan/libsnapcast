# Snapcast C Client

This library aims to be a portable C library to connect to a Snapserver from the [Snapcast](https://github.com/badaix/snapcast) project.

The initial goal for this library is to run on the ESP32 and make use of the [ESP-ADF](https://github.com/espressif/esp-adf) for the audio pipeline framework. It should be possible to construct an audio stream which we can then feed into the pipeline example.

**This is not functional at this stage.**
